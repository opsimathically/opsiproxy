The code from the HTTP proxy is based off the wonderful project http-mitm-proxy,
written by Joe Ferner.  He licensed the project as MIT, giving us an excellent
and robust foundation to start our work from.  Thank you Joe, from the bottom
of my heart as a security researcher, as you've provided something foundationally
useful to piviot off of.  I'd love to work with you in the future on proxy features
et al.  Contact me if you're interested!
