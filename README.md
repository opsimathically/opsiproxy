DO NOT USE, THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.  I AM REWRITING OLD PROXY CODE THAT INTERFACED 
WITH PUBLIC PACKAGES.  WILL UPDATE THIS README WITH INDICATION WHEN READY.

```bash
npm install @opsimathically/opsiproxy

## Building from source

This package is intended to be run via npm, but if you'd like to build from source,
clone this repo, enter directory, and run `npm install` for dev dependencies, then run
`npm run build`.
